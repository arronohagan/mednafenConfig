# mednafenConfig
My personal Mednafen config and sample "type" file.

This repo contains my personal Mednafen config. 
When I first tried to use 3rd generation Pokemon games with the built in GBA emulator, they wouldn't work. 
That's where the attacked ".type" file comes in. 
The .type file is copied from the .sav file created in the .mednafen/sav directory, but the extension is changed to .type and a couple of alterations have been made to allow the games to work, as well as the real time clock.

Enjoy!
